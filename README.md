Hi, I'm <b>Muktan</b> 👋. I have research interests in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>, specifically in Natural Language Processing. Moreover, I play chess ♟️ and listening Piano 🎹 and other instrumentals.

**Current Status Quo**

- 🔭 I’m currently Researching and Working on <b>End-to-End Speech Recognition(ASR)</b>.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning <b>Object detection</b> using deep learning.
- 💼 I’m pursuing a <b>B Tech. Computer Engineering degree at Dharmsinh Desai University,Nadiad</b>.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I would like to answer.
- 📫 Please email via muktan123@gmail.com to reach me.
- 👀 See my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OdeaMP59QEVeTXUIzx6o-4AtJW-XQ4Gq/view?usp=sharing) to get more info.

**Research Experience**
- <b>Title:</b> End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR)
- <b>Task Performed:</b><br/>
      - Converted I/P features to MFCC instead of a power spectrogram, reducing the input size by 84%.
      - Adapted this system for the regional language - Gujarati, too.
      - Scrapped data consisting of 2.5 million words from Wikipedia to use as a corpus for the language model.
      - Performed character-level error analysis for our system.
      - Innovated various post-processing techniques such as prefix beam decoding with couple language models and BERT spell corrector that reduced the word error rate by 5.1%.
      - This research work was accepted to ICON 2020, 17th International Conference on Natural Language Processing, organized by NLP Association, India and AI-NLP-ML Group, IIT Patna.
**Work Experience**
- <b>Company</b>: Atliq Technologies, Vadodara
- <b>Designation:</b> Python Developer Intern
- <b>Internship Period:</b> 2 months (April 2020 - June 2020)
- <b>Accomplished:</b><br/>
      - Improved ingestion performance by <b>80%</b> by Indexing table and refactoring code.<br/>
      - Increased code coverage by <b>35%</b> by writing test cases in <b>Pytest</b>.<br/>
      - Refactored code such that it uses <b>OOP</b> concepts.<br/>

**Skills**

- 🎯 Artificial Intelligence.
- 🎯 Python
- 🎯 Research
